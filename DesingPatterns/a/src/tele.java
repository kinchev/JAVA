//Write a method in any programming language you like that is checking whether a given array is "telescopic".
//An array is called telescopic if its outer elements are 1's, then the next inner elements are 2's and so on. There is exactly one telescopic array of a given length. Here are the first five telescopic arrays with size 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:

public class tele {




    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
